F this, it intends to target women between age 25 and 40 who have indicated that they are single in their profile on Social Media ABC. Jewellery Best uses the corresponding targeting criteria offered by Social Media ABC to identify the target group to whom its advertisement should be displayed. Moreover, it indicates that the advertisement should be displayed to Social Media ABC's users while they are using the social media service between 6-9 pm. To target users, Social Media ABC has previously determined which types of personal data should be used in order to develop the targeting criteria and which targeting criteria should be offered. Social Media ABC also communicates certain statistical information to Jewellery Best once the advertisements have been displayed. What are the roles of Jewellery Best and Social Media ABC?",
